# Overview
VEGA is the result of some unused (and unfinished) code from Discord's [2019 Hack Week](https://blog.discord.com/discord-community-hack-week-category-winners-bd0364360f92), where a bot that could fit ALL categories was to somehow be made in a week. ~~Boy, was that a mistake.~~

While being made from unfinished and unused code, since then, VEGA has turned into it's own bot, originally being named Senko-san/Kona-bot, sporting features ranging from:

- Moderation
- Utility Commands
- General Fun & Games
- (Indev) Economy Functionality
- (Indev) Full Server Configuration
- NSFW Commands

With more to come in the future. As an up-side, VEGA is completely open-source, with templates for bot configuration, server settings, and more. Installation is easy as well, only requiring [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and of course, the libraries within [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Zeexel/VEGA/blob/master/requirements.txt). Adding new features and command categories, hoever, requires some knowledge in programming.
